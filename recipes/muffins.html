    <h3 class="disc">Description</h3>
    <p class="body">
        We make a version of these muffins all the time — sometimes swapping strawberries for other fruits like blueberries. The batter is straightforward — flour, baking powder, a little oil, egg, milk, and vanilla extract.
    </p>
    <p class="body">
        In the strawberry muffin recipe below, you’ll notice we added a few extra spices to the batter — cinnamon and finely ground black pepper. It’s not often you see black pepper in sweet baked goods, but trust us, it’s so good.
    </p>
    <p class="body">
        You don’t specifically taste the pepper, but it lifts the flavor of everything in the muffin. Try it. We love it.<strong>Try to use strawberries that are sweet and flavorful for these muffins.</strong> If you can’t find them, try other berries — blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, or cherries would be amazing.

        Just before baking, we add a <em>Sugary top</em> to the muffins. It’s completely optional, but we love the tiny bit of crunch it adds once they’ve baked.
